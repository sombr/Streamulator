Streamulator
============

Streams Emulator - basic Event-based emulator of delays in
data-flow processing by Pumpers/Streams infrastructure framework.

Allows to build simple data-flow schemes with Stream::Storages ( implemented common RoundRobin mechanism ) and
Pumpers ( data-processors ) with pre-measured work-iteration intervals and find data stalling points in scheme.

SEE: https://github.com/berekuk/Stream-Core for actual Streams framework code.
